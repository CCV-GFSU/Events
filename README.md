### Session Proposal Template

Please use the format provided and send an issue in this repository with all the details.

### How to use Template

#### Method 2
Simply visit [issues](https://github.com/CCV-GFSU/Events/issues) section. Click on **new issue**, a window will appear and then click on **get started**. Issue page with the template will be ready for you.
